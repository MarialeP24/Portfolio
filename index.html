    <p>Hello! My name is Alejandra , I have a background in architecture and design, I have spent over six years bridging public policy and spatial design, focusing on community-driven and impactful projects. My work at the Ministry of Education in Peru involved leading nationwide school infrastructure initiatives, emphasizing innovative solutions for rural areas. Later, at El Equipo Mazzanti, I contributed to research-driven projects that reimagine public spaces. Now, as a Master in Design Studies candidate at Harvard GSD, I explore the intersections of policy, public space, and climate-responsive urban design, aiming to shape inclusive and resilient environments through participatory and data-driven strategies. </p>
