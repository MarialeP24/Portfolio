					Equal Outcomes - Substantiation of Complaints by Race

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Use of a Horizontal Bar Chart
					Earnest Score: 1 (Mostly Neutral, Slightly Earnest)
					Horizontal bars make it easier to compare percentages and reduce visual exaggeration that can occur in vertical bars.
					Ordering bars from highest to lowest further minimizes perceived differences, making the rates look more uniform.</li>
				<li>Uniform Color Palette (Shades of Blue)
					Earnest Score: 1.5 (Subtly Earnest)
					A single color family avoids implying that one group is favored or disadvantaged.
					If contrasting colors (e.g., red for Black complainants and green for White complainants) were used, it could create an artificial sense of disparity.</li>
				<li>Title Framing: "Complaint Substantiation Rates Show No Significant Racial Differences"
					Earnest Score: -1.5 (Moderately Deceptive)
					The title subtly implies fairness by using the term "no significant racial differences."
					This primes the audience to interpret the chart through a fairness lens before even looking at the data.</li>
				<li> Exclusion of Total Complaint Volume
					Earnest Score: -2 (Fully Deceptive)
					By focusing only on substantiation rates, this visualization ignores the vastly different number of complaints filed by different racial groups.
					This omission is strategic: if viewers don’t see the total complaint volume, they won’t question the results</li>
