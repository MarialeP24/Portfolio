					Equal Outcomes - Substantiation of Complaints by Race
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Use of a Horizontal Bar Chart
					Earnest Score: 1 (Mostly Neutral, Slightly Earnest)
					Horizontal bars make it easier to compare percentages and reduce visual exaggeration that can occur in vertical bars.
					Ordering bars from highest to lowest further minimizes perceived differences, making the rates look more uniform.</li>
				<li>Uniform Color Palette (Shades of Blue)
					Earnest Score: 1.5 (Subtly Earnest)
					A single color family avoids implying that one group is favored or disadvantaged.
					If contrasting colors (e.g., red for Black complainants and green for White complainants) were used, it could create an artificial sense of disparity.</li>
				<li>Title Framing: "Complaint Substantiation Rates Show No Significant Racial Differences"
					Earnest Score: -1.5 (Moderately Deceptive)
					The title subtly implies fairness by using the term "no significant racial differences."
					This primes the audience to interpret the chart through a fairness lens before even looking at the data.</li>
				<li> Exclusion of Total Complaint Volume
					Earnest Score: -2 (Fully Deceptive)
					By focusing only on substantiation rates, this visualization ignores the vastly different number of complaints filed by different racial groups.
					This omission is strategic: if viewers don’t see the total complaint volume, they won’t question the results</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

				<img src="IMAGE_FILENAME" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				More Complaints, Same Results: Do Racial Disparities in Policing Go Unsubstantiated?
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Dual-Axis Chart (Bar for Total Complaints, Line for Substantiated Complaints)
					Earnest Score: 2 (Fully Earnest)
					This format allows both data points to be visible:
					Total complaints (bar chart)
					Substantiated complaints (line overlay)
					It accurately represents disparities without manipulating the axis or scaling.</li>
				<li>Expanded Y-Axis to Emphasize Volume Disparities
					Earnest Score: 0.5 (Slightly Earnest)
					Here we expand the Y-axis to maximize the perception of disparities.
					This is not fully deceptive, because all values remain accurate, but it frames the disparity as more extreme than if the Y-axis were adjusted to show proportionality.</li>
				<li>Title Framing: "More Complaints, Same Results: Do Racial Disparities in Policing Go Unsubstantiated?"
					Earnest Score: -1.5 (Moderately Deceptive)
					The phrase "Racial Disparities in Policing" already presumes bias, influencing how readers interpret the chart.
					The phrase "More Complaints, Same Results" implies that substantiation rates should be higher for Black and Latino complainants, even though there is no definitive statistical rule that says this should be the case.</li>
				<li>Callouts Highlighting Complaint Differences
					Earnest Score: -1 (Slightly Deceptive)
					Annotations explicitly state: "Black complainants file 3x more complaints than White complainants, yet receive the same substantiation rate."
					This frames the equal substantiation rate as a negative outcome, which encourages the audience to assume systemic bias.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>This exercise underscored how the same dataset can be leveraged to tell two vastly different narratives—one reinforcing the idea of fairness, and another exposing potential systemic bias—purely through strategic emphasis and omission. It became clear that visual encoding is not just an aesthetic choice but a fundamental tool in shaping audience perception; subtle adjustments in color, axis scaling, and annotations can dramatically alter the way data is interpreted. What was most striking is that deception is rarely outright manipulation; rather, it often operates in the gray area of selective framing—for instance, omitting total complaint volume in Visualization 1 makes the process appear more equitable than it may actually be. One particularly surprising moment was realizing how Visualization 2, which highlights disparities in total complaints, fundamentally shifts the audience's focus away from the seemingly neutral substantiation rates and toward systemic disparities in policing experiences. Even though the substantiation rates are objectively similar across racial groups, the sheer volume of complaints from Black and Latino individuals—when placed in direct contrast to White complainants—raises new questions that the first visualization deliberately suppresses. This raises critical questions about the boundary between persuasive storytelling and ethical responsibility in data visualization. If we acknowledge that some degree of framing is inevitable, where do we draw the line between acceptable emphasis and misleading distortion? While using titles to suggest an interpretation or adjusting color schemes for clarity may be fair game, truncating axes to minimize differences or selectively omitting key contextual information can actively mislead viewers. This realization reinforces that visualization ethics is not just about data accuracy, but also about transparency—ensuring that the choices we make do not conceal crucial insights, even as we seek to craft persuasive narratives.</p>
